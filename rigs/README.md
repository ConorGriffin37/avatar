# Rigs
This folder contains FBX files for the most popular R15 bodies found in Roblox games. Developers are welcome to use these templates as a starting point to create custom animations using the Animation Editor in Roblox Studio. If you prefer to animate using a 3rd-party authoring tool, then the final animation can be imported back into Roblox using the Avatar Importer plugin that comes with Roblox Studio.
