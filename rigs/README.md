# Rigs
This folder contains FBX files for the most common R15 bodies found in Roblox games. Developers are welcome to use these templates as a starting point to create custom animations using their preferred 3rd-party authoring tool. The final animation can be imported back into Roblox using the Avatar Importer plugin that comes with Roblox Studio.
